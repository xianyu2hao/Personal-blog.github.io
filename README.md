**我的个人博客** 是一个简单, 漂亮, 和一个花里胡哨的 Jekyll主题 博客。 它是建立于 [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole) 和 [Pure](https://purecss.io/).

> Poole explains that Jekyll has been asking for a particular chemical for days now but every time it has been fetched for him he rejects it as **not pure**. Poole also explains that he caught a glimpse of the man inside and he looked barely human.
